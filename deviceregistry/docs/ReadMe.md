# Device Registry 
<a name="deviceregistry"/><br />

## System Design Description Overview
<a name="deviceregistry_sdd" /><br />

This System provides the database, which stores information related to the Devices within the Local Cloud.

The purpose of this System is therefore to allow:
-	Devices to register themselves, making this announcement available to other Application Systems on the network. 
-	They are also allowed to remove or update their entries when it is necessary. 
-   Generate a client certificate which can be used by the Device to register its Systems

## Services and Use Cases
<a name="deviceregistry_usecases" />

This System provides two Core Service: the __device registration__ and __de-registration__.
Further it provides two Onboarding Services: the __onboarding with name__ and __onboarding with CSR__.

The __register__ method is used to register a device. The device will contain various metadata as well as a physical endpoint. 
The various parameters are representing the endpoint information that should be registered.

The __unregister__ method is used to unregister device instances that were previously registered in the Registry. 
The instance parameter is representing the endpoint information that should be removed.

The __onboarding__ methods are used to register a device and to retrieve a device certificate which must be used on the next step of the onboarding procedure.

## Security
<a name="deviceregistry_security" />

This System can be secured via the HTTPS protocol. If it is started in secure mode, it verifies whether the Application System possesses a proper X.509 identity certificate and whether that certificate is Arrowhead compliant in its making. This certificate structure and creation guidelines ensure:
-	Application System is properly bootstrapped into the Local Cloud
-	The Application System indeed belongs to this Local Cloud
-	The Application System then automatically has the right to register its Systems in the Registry.

If these criteria are met, the Application Systemâ€™s registration or removal message is processed. An Application System can only delete or alter entries that contain the Device as the System Provider in the entry. 


## Endpoints
<a name="deviceregistry_endpoints" />

The System Registry offers four types of endpoints. Onboarding, Client, Management and Private.

Swagger API documentation is available on: `https://<host>:<port>` <br />
The base URL for the requests: `http://<host>:<port>/deviceregistry`

### Detailed description<br />

A detailed description of management and private endpoints is available in the release notes.

### Onboard with Name
<a name="deviceregistry_endpoints_onboarding_name" />

```
POST /onboarding/name
```

Creates a CSR on behalf of the client, registers the device and eventually returns a device certificate which may be used in the next step of the onboarding controller.
